# IBBJS
JavaScript version of Impossible Bridge Book.

Now that there is an arbitrary precision integer class built into Javsscript,
it is easy to implement The Impossible Bridge Book in the browser.

Addition change for commit.

For personal edducation reasons, I am going to try to do the project in TypeScript and compile to Javascript.
