# IBBJS
TypeScript/JavaScript version of The Impossible Bridge Book.

Now that there is an arbitrary precision integer class built into Javsscript,
it is easy to implement The Impossible Bridge Book entirely in the browser.

For personal education reasons, I am going to try to do the project in TypeScript and compile to Javascript. 

Working with npm, tcm, jest, and VSCode.

To run, 

   1. Clone the repository
   2. Run 'npm install' 
   3. Run 'npm run build'
   4. Copy to contents of the dest/ folder to a directory visible to a browser.
   5. Open test.html in a browser.
