# IBBJS
TypeScript/JavaScript version of The Impossible Bridge Book.

I deploy this on my [GitHub Pages](https://thomasoa.github.io/impossible/index.html) page.

Now that there is an arbitrary precision integer class built into Javsscript,
it is easy to implement The Impossible Bridge Book entirely in the browser.

For personal education reasons, I am going to try to do the project in TypeScript and compile to Javascript. 

Working with npm, tcm, jest, and VSCode.

To run, you will need `npm` installed.

   1. Clone the repository
   2. Run `npm install`
   3. Run `npm run build`
   4. Copy the contents of the `dest/` folder to a directory visible to a browser.
   5. Open `index.html` in a browser.
